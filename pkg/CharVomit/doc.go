// Package CharVomit provides functionality to generate large
// pseudo-random passwords, that look as if a cat puked up random
// characters. The code uses crypto/rand for random number generation,
// but does allow you to eliminate characters that are confusing, such
// as the digit '0' and the capital letter 'O'.
